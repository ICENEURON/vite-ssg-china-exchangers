            "description": "Each flow channel is meticulously formed by welding plates together. The plate pack, comprising a precisely calculated number of plates, is securely installed within a robust frame, ensuring seamless integration with the production system. In this configuration, challenging fluids, such as those containing solids or high-viscosity suspensions, are directed through the wide gap channels. These channels are specifically engineered to prevent clogging and facilitate uninterrupted flow. On the other hand, clean fluids are routed through the opposite side channels, which are optimized for superior thermal performance and operational reliability. This heat exchanger is available in both horizontal and vertical installation configurations. The vertical design offers more advantages, including a significantly smaller footprint, reduced susceptibility to clogging, and lower pressure drop, making it an optimal choice for space-constrained environments and applications requiring enhanced flow efficiency.",
