        {
          "question": "Is this template free to use?",
          "answer": "Yes, this project is open source and released under the MIT License. You can use it for personal or commercial projects without any restrictions."

        },
        {
          "question": "Why should I use this over Next.js?",
          "answer": "If you don't need server-side rendering (SSR) or complex backend features, this template offers a simpler, lighter architecture. It produces static files that can be hosted anywhere, often resulting in lower costs and better security."

      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "Can I use this with a CMS?",
          "answer": "Absolutely. Since this is a static site generator, you can fetch content from any Headless CMS (like Contentful, Strapi, or Sanity) at build time and generate pages."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I add a new route?",
          "answer": "Simply add a new file to the `src/pages` directory. The file-based routing system will automatically create a route for it. For example, `src/pages/about.tsx` becomes `/about`."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does it support API routes?",
          "answer": "No, this is a purely static frontend template. If you need backend API routes, you will need to deploy a separate backend service or use serverless functions (like Vercel Functions or AWS Lambda)."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I change the styling theme?",
          "answer": "You can customize the theme variables in `src/index.css`. The core colors are defined as CSS variables that Tailwind uses. You can also edit `tailwind.config.js` to change fonts, spacing, and other design tokens."

        },
        {
          "question": "Images are not loading after deployment.",
          "answer": "Ensure you are using the correct paths. Assets in the `public` directory should be referenced with a leading slash (e.g., `/logo.png`). If you are deploying to a subdirectory, you may need to set the `base` in `vite.config.ts`."
