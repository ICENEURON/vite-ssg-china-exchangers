      "Small cap share prices can move sharply on hype, rumours and short-term news. That noise is hard to predict and even harder to rely on.",
      "Instead of chasing every spike, I start with the basics: how the company makes money, what shape its financial statements are in, how strong its position is against competitors and whether there is a credible way to turn growth into lasting profit and cash flow.",
      "If the underlying business does not make sense, the share price story usually does not last. That is why every company that appears on the weekly watchlist has first passed a simple fundamentals check like the one described on this page."
