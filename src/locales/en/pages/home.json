      "title": "What Are ASX Small Cap and Penny Stocks?",
      "content": [
        "ASX small cap stocks are companies listed on the Australian Securities Exchange with relatively small market capitalisation. Many of them trade at lower share prices, which is why people often call them penny stocks or low-priced shares.",
        "These businesses can be early-stage, rapidly growing or still trying to prove their business model. Because of their size, small caps are usually more volatile than large blue-chip companies. A single announcement, capital raise or contract win can move the share price dramatically in a short period of time.",
        "This volatility is a double-edged sword. It can create the potential for outsized gains if a company executes well over many years. It can also lead to permanent capital loss if the business fails, dilutes shareholders heavily or never becomes sustainably profitable. That is why small caps demand careful research, realistic expectations and a strong tolerance for risk."

    "howToUse": {
      "title": "How to Use This Weekly Watchlist",
      "content": [
        "The ASX small cap watchlist is designed as a starting point for your own research, not as a list of buy or sell recommendations. Every company on the list carries significant risk, and you should assume that any of them could underperform or fail completely.",
        "If you decide to look deeper into a company, read its latest annual and quarterly reports, review recent announcements, and think honestly about your own risk tolerance and time horizon. You may also want to speak with a licensed financial adviser before making any investment decisions.",
        "Finally, remember that good process is more important than individual stock picks. The purpose of this project is to improve decision-making over time by writing things down, reviewing past ideas and learning from both successes and mistakes."
